# When Once the Sky Was Blue

<p align="center">
<i>
In the not-so-distant future, the world has been consumed by darkness. In this eerie world stand three cloaked figures, glowing in the darkness. They beckon you to come closer, and in a collective voice say to you:
<br>
"Do you remember when the sky was blue?‚Äù
</i>
</p>

This immersive web experience aims to deal with eco-grief and collective trauma during the Anthropocene. Through poetry, visuals and immersive sound, be guided through a journey exploring three ecosystems from the comfort of your home. You choose where to begin in this performance encouraging mindfulness practices.
