0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What does it feel like?

1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Tell me

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What does it feel like to have the earth beneath you?

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Imagine, a weight pushing down on you.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
On your shoulders, and pressing you deep into the ground.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What is it like?

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is the ground hard?

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is it cold?

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Imagine being in a vast garden.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are walking, and wandering through an endless field.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now, imagine that with each step you take,

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
you sink slowly into the earth.

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Step, by step, by step

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
until you are waist-deep in the soil,

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
one plant among others.

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A daisy grows nearby, its petal gently tickling your ear.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is the smallest movement you can make with your body?

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,120
Can you move your toe or even your ear?

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Can you move a single eye lash?

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,120
Be gentle, be slow.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Focus on the little movements in your body.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Now gradually accelerate the movement.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,150
Let it affect other parts of your body.

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,100
If you move fast enough,

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,100
if you twist and turn, will you break away from the soil?

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,150
From the earth’s embrace?

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Look past the horizon.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,080
The earth has begun to harden

28
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,000
The earth has begun to harden
Dry air, dry skin, slowly cracking from the heat.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Where are you, in this moment in time and space?

30
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,000
Time passes in the blink of an eye

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And this moment fades as soon as it happens.

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But a memory shared, can last a little longer.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
And I think...

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,100
I think I can…

35
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,000
remember.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, I do.

37
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,120
How it felt to be outside, by the mountains.

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,050
The earth below me was rough, uneven.

39
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,000
The terrain was unpredictable but there was no doubt

40
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,200
The ground was solid.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A slight force pulling me down,

42
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,000
stopping me from wandering, floating off the earth.

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And I could feel it, I did.

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
My head towards the sun,

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the sweat trickling down, caressing my spine.

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My legs, steady, and connected to the earth.

47
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The energy from the sun, traveling through me to nourish the earth.

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,120
Grass between my toes.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I turned my head up and could see the sky come alive.

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The stories of my ancestors written in the stars.

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,120
There was a time when it was all alive.

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,120
And maybe it will be once again.
