0
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,240
Look around you

1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:17,200
Yes, look around and tell me, what do you see?

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,240
Can you imagine if the walls around you

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,320
got further and further away?

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,320
Expanding your space

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,350
Giving you room to move

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
To breathe

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Close your eyes

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Can you tilt your head up?

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Face the sky above

10
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,200
And feel the sun’s heat

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,200
A gentle warmth that first touches your nose

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,200
Then spreads to your cheeks.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Let your head relax

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Let it sway gently.

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,200
Breathe.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
When you're ready, open your eyes.

17
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,200
Take in your surroundings.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,400
And as you do, let your shoulders,

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:45,400
your spine, feel the weight of your head.

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
This weight I feel in my body

21
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,300
Is one I’ve kept with me for so long.

22
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,300
I feel it in my chest,

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,300
a pressure that travels from my core to my limbs

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Till the tips of my toes, my fingers feel numb.

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,300
A space once vast,

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,320
the walls become tighter until the once

27
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,200
endless space suddenly illuminates itself to be finite.

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,300
The embers grow, they travel and feed off my body

29
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,300
an embrace that soon becomes

30
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Suffocating.

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,300
Treat this screen as a window

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,300
And this window as a light

33
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,250
And look around you to remember

34
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,200
Where you are.

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,300
Grab onto the real.

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,200
Count the objects closest to you

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,200
1, 2, 3, 4

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Count the memories left around you, within you

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,240
Memories taste as sweet as candy canes

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,400
But the real, what exists now,

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
tastes burnt.

42
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
Charred is my space.

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,320
Burnt is my body.

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,200
My air I no longer trust.

45
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Will you breathe with me?

46
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,250
Your breath,

47
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,200
is my salvation.

48
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,320
And I hope

49
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,380
This

50
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Will create

51
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
a new

52
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,360
beginning.
