0
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,040
Look around you

1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, look around and tell me, what do you see?

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,040
Can you imagine if the walls around you

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,120
got further and further away?

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,120
Expanding your space

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,150
Giving you room to move

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
To breathe

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Close your eyes

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Can you tilt your head up?

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Face the sky above

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,000
And feel the sun’s heat

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A gentle warmth that first touches your nose

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Then spreads to your cheeks.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let your head relax

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let it sway gently.

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,000
Breathe.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
When you're ready, open your eyes.

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,000
Take in your surroundings.

18
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,200
And as you do, let your shoulders,

19
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:45,200
your spine, feel the weight of your head.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This weight I feel in my body

21
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,100
Is one I’ve kept with me for so long.

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,100
I feel it in my chest,

23
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,100
a pressure that travels from my core to my limbs

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,200
Till the tips of my toes, my fingers feel numb.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,100
A space once vast,

26
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,120
the walls become tighter until the once

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,000
endless space suddenly illuminates itself to be finite.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,100
The embers grow, they travel and feed off my body

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,100
an embrace that soon becomes

30
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Suffocating.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,100
Treat this screen as a window

32
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,100
And this window as a light

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,050
And look around you to remember

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,000
Where you are.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,100
Grab onto the real.

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,000
Count the objects closest to you

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
1, 2, 3, 4

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Count the memories left around you, within you

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,040
Memories taste as sweet as candy canes

40
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,200
But the real, what exists now,

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
tastes burnt.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Charred is my space.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,120
Burnt is my body.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
My air I no longer trust.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Will you breathe with me?

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,050
Your breath,

47
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,000
is my salvation.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,120
And I hope

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,180
This

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Will create

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
a new

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,160
beginning.
