0
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,000
Do you remember when the sky was blue?

1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We do.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But the memory is faint.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So much has happened since then.

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,000
Chaos.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Cacophony. Catastrophe.

6
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,000
We welcome you, as one of us.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you look down, you’ll see the edges of your white cloak.

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,000
Light, emanates from within us.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And it emanates from within you.

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,010
Look above, and you’ll see that this world

11
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,200
has been enveloped by darkness.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,000
This, is only temporary.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And now that you’re here,

14
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,000
we can begin.
