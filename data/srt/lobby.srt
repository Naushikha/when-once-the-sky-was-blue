0
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:05,200
Do you remember when the sky was blue?

1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,200
We do.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,200
But the memory is faint.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,200
So much has happened since then.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,200
Chaos.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Cacophony. Catastrophe.

6
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,200
We welcome you, as one of us.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,200
If you look down, you’ll see the edges of your white cloak.

8
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,200
Light, emanates from within us.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,200
And it emanates from within you.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,210
Look above, and you’ll see that this world

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,400
has been enveloped by darkness.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,200
This, is only temporary.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,200
And now that you’re here,

14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,200
we can begin.
