0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Do you remember when the sky was blue?

1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We do.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But the memory is faint.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So much has happened since then.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Chaos.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Cacophony. Catastrophe.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We welcome you, as one of us.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you look down, you’ll see the edges of your white cloak.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Light, emanates from within us.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And it emanates from within you.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Look above, and you’ll see that this world

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
has been enveloped by darkness.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This, is only temporary.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And now that you’re here,

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
we can begin.
