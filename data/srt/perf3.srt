0
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,340
Relax.

1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,200
Drop your shoulders.

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Release the tension in your body.

3
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,200
Just breathe.

4
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Thank you

5
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
for sharing in this moment,

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,320
being in this space with me.

7
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,200
You and I

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Are one in the same.

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
I hear your heart beat

10
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Can you hear it too?

11
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,300
How was your day?

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
Is it just getting started?

13
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Or has the sun already set?

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Or does the day melt from one day to the next?

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,300
Never stopping, always moving.

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,300
Never stopping, always moving.

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Always

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,300
moving.

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,200
The future is

20
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Uncertain

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,200
Dark greys appear over the blue sky

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,280
but don’t lose sight

23
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,200
of the horizon ahead.

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
One heart

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
And air that is shared

26
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,200
And a body that is searching

27
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,320
Searching

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
For an answer.

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,200
For something more.

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,200
You and I

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Are one in the same.

32
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,300
Lines erased

33
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,400
Dismantle the lines, the walls,

34
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,420
the imaginary boundaries between us.

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Breathe.

36
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,200
Do you see?

37
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,200
You and I

38
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,200
are one in the same.

39
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,300
You and I

40
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,360
Are one.
