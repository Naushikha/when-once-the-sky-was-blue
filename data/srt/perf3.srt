0
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,140
Relax.

1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Drop your shoulders.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Release the tension in your body.

3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:40,000
Just breathe.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
for sharing in this moment,

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,120
being in this space with me.

7
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,000
You and I

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Are one in the same.

9
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,000
I hear your heart beat

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Can you hear it too?

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,100
How was your day?

12
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,000
Is it just getting started?

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Or has the sun already set?

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Or does the day melt from one day to the next?

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,100
Never stopping, always moving.

16
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,100
Never stopping, always moving.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Always

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,100
moving.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The future is

20
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Uncertain

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Dark greys appear over the blue sky

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,080
but don’t lose sight

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,000
of the horizon ahead.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
One heart

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And air that is shared

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And a body that is searching

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,120
Searching

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
For an answer.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
For something more.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You and I

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,200
Are one in the same.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,100
Lines erased

33
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,200
Dismantle the lines, the walls,

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,220
the imaginary boundaries between us.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Breathe.

36
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,000
Do you see?

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You and I

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
are one in the same.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,100
You and I

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,160
Are one.
